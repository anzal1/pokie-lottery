### Installation

_Below are the instructions to setup this project and get started with._

1. Clone the repo

   ```
2. Install NPM packages for `client` and `smart_contracts` folder
   ```sh
   npm install

3. Generate an API url for contracts and add your url to `hardhat.config.js` file using [Alchemy.io](https://www.alchemy.com/)
   ```js
   // hardhat.config.js file in smart_contracts
    ropsten: {
      url: {/* Your own url of contracts */},
    },
   ```
4. Add your metamask account's private key in `.env` file of smart_contract dir
   ```sh
   PRIVATE_KEY=Metamask account private key
   ```
5. Compile the smart_contracts using
   ```sh
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network ropsten
   ```
   This will compile contracts and provide the addresses of deployed contracts.
6. Create `.env` file in `client` folder and enter the contract addresses as shown below.

   // add your addresses to .env
   VITE_TRANSACTION_CONTRACT=
   VITE_ACE_TOKEN_CONTRACT=
